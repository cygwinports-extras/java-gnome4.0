ldesc: "This is the java-gnome language bindings project. We endeavour 
to provide a high quality library you can use to write GTK and GNOME 
programs. The underlying APIs are elegantly transformed into Java and 
carefully documented so that anyone new to Linux or Open Source can 
rapidly be on their way to creating fabulous applications."
